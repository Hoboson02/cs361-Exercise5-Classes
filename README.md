This exercise lets us practice some tiny but important principles from Martin's Clean Code.

Application of Principle
Create a repository with a README.md and an empty main.rb. Open your empty main.rb in your editor, and take the following code and paste it into your editor.
Now, modify the code to reflect the principles from Clean Code, chapters 9, 10 and 12.
